// The Fortune Teller
//
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
//
// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var children = 0;
var partner = "Kristy";
var geoLocation = "Sydney";
var job = "Landscape Gardener";
var fortune = "You will be a " + job + " in " + geoLocation + " and married to " + partner + " with " + children + " kids.";

console.log(fortune);
